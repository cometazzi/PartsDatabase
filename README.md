#### Problem Statement

I am an electronics hobbyist, and building devices or just tinkering on things requires a vast array of different parts.  Integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, capacitors, resistors, vacuum tubes and many more.  The problem is, after so many years I have accumulated many many parts, and I can no longer keep track of the inventory in my head.

PartsDatabase is an inventory system to catalogue electronic parts, pieces, modules, bits, and bobs.  Ideally it would involve a searchable database that can allow a user to list all the parts, or all the parts in a category, and display the quantiy of a particular part in stock.  Some base data, such as listing some general specifications and ratings of each part would be good to have, particularly if those fields are searchable as well.
