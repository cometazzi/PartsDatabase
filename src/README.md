### Problem Statement

I am an electronics hobbyist, and building devices or just tinkering on things requires a vast array of different parts.  Integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, capacitors, resistors, vacuum tubes and many more.  The problem is, after so many years I have accumulated many many parts, and I can no longer keep track of the inventory in my head.

I wish to create an inventory system to catalogue all my electronic parts, pieces, modules, bits, and bobs.  Ideally it would involve a searchable database that can allow me to list all the parts, or all the parts in a category, and tell me how many of a particular part that I have.  Some base data, such as listing some general specifications and ratings of each part would be good to have, particularly if I could search via those fields as well.
