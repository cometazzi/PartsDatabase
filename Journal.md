Document project progress, the development process, accomplishments, snags, and time spent on this class. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as this information is shared.

[Time Log](TimeLog.md)

### Week 1 - Spring 2025
1/19/2025

Tasks Completed:
* Chose a project goal
* Created this repository
* Wrote problem statement
* Started documenting the project

### Week 2 
1/26/2025

### Week 3
2/4/2025

* Added missing files (Journal.md, Readme.md)
* Created screen design, hashed out some logistical choices
* Hashed out some illogistical choices as well.

### Week 4
2/10/2025

Some thoughts, for better or for worse:
* Transistor Table: image_url, part_num, descr ("BJT NPN Small Signal Transistor"), qty, package, cost, vendor, datasheet_url
* Chipamp Table: image_url, part_num, descr ("480mW Audio Amplifier IC"), qty, package, cost, vendor datasheet_url
* Linear IC Table: image_url, part_num, descr ("JFET Input Dual Operational Amplifier"), qty, package, cost, vendor, datasheet_url
* Logic IC Table: image_url, part_num, descr ("CMOS Input Hex Buffer / Line Driver"), qty, package, cost, vendor, datasheet_url
* Diode Table: image_url, part_num, descr ("Vintage NOS Germanium Diode"), qty, package, cost, vendor, datasheet_url
* Capacitor Table: image_url, value, descr ("Silver Mica 500V Capacitor"), qty, package (radial, axial), vendor, datasheet_url
* Resistor Table: image_url, value, descr ("1/2W Carbon Film Resistor"), qty, package (all radial, maybe not?), cost
* Other Table: image_url, descr ("Hall Effects Sensor"), qty, mounting_style, cost, vendor, datasheet_url

Something to consider, not all items have datasheets, like resistors, knobs, switches, etc.  The "datasheet_url" for these items
  would instead point to a non-working button that says "no datasheet" or similar.

Also, this is a LOT of data to have to compile and type in.  Maybe some of these fields aren't necessary, like vendor.
